          <p>Dreams are important, especially when we are young. Many children discover they have color vision deficiency (CVD) too late—often when pursuing careers like medicine or aviation. This late discovery shatters dreams and leaves individuals feeling lost about their future. The challenge is to help parents identify CVD early in their children's lives, allowing kids to explore alternative passions and dreams before career paths are set.</p>

          <p>I conducted in-depth interviews with individuals who discovered they have color vision deficiency later in life, particularly those who aspired to careers like medicine or aviation. Through conversations about their experiences, dreams, and how early detection might have changed their paths, I gained deep insights into their emotional journeys. The interviews revealed common themes around shattered dreams, feelings of lost potential, and the importance of early detection. Most importantly, participants emphasized that children have amazing imagination and curiosity, which is the perfect time to explore alternative passions. These findings directly informed the app's concept and design approach.</p>

          <p>Through interviews, I found that people with CVD often discover it when they get to university and want to pursue their dreams. Most wanted to be doctors and pilots. When asked if they knew earlier, how would it change their lives, the response was: "If I knew earlier, it would help me find other passions early and have other dreams, because children have amazing imagination and that's when they are the most curious about life." This sparked the idea to create an app for parents to find out if their kids have CVD early through a game.</p>

          <p>I conducted usability testing sessions with parents and their children using the low-fidelity wireframes of the game. Parents were asked to guide their children through the testing process, while children interacted with the shape identification game. The testing revealed that children engaged better with game-like interfaces, but some shapes and instructions needed to be clearer. Parents also expressed the need for more detailed results and guidance on next steps. Based on these findings, I refined the wireframes to improve clarity, simplify instructions, and enhance the overall testing experience before moving to high-fidelity designs.</p>

          <p>The app has shown promising results in early testing phases. Parents reported that their children enjoyed the game-like experience and didn't realize they were being tested. The accuracy of CVD detection aligned well with professional optometric assessments. Several parents discovered their children had mild CVD that would have gone undetected for years. Most importantly, early detection has enabled these families to have important conversations about career planning and passion exploration at an age when children are most open to discovering new interests. The app has helped shift the narrative from "shattered dreams" to "redirected potential."</p>

          <p>Through an iterative design process, I developed Peek-A-Shape, a game that helps parents identify color vision deficiency early in their children's lives. By making it a game, children feel less intimidated and are more engaged in the testing process. This early detection allows kids to explore alternative passions and dreams before career paths are set, helping them find other things to do while maintaining their curiosity and imagination. This project taught me the importance of designing with empathy, balancing scientific accuracy with user experience, and creating solutions that can have a meaningful impact on people's lives.</p>
