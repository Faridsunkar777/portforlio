Most people deleted the apps because it limited them and we figured that we needed to make something that gives them choice rather than fully restricting them completely.

                <p>After testing and receiving approval, I enhanced the visual design following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Building the iOS app in Swift and Xcode was my first experience with these tools. Despite the learning curve, I successfully translated the designs into a high-fidelity prototype, bringing the concept to life.</p>

                <p>Reflecting on this project, it truly felt like embarking on a creative journey. I started with a simple question: how can we help people become more mindful of their screen time? Along the way, I experimented with techniques like Crazy 8s, letting my ideas flow freely on paper as I imagined how users might interact with Luna. Through user interviews, I began to understand real stories — the struggles, motivations, and daily routines that shaped people's habits.</p>
                <p>Diving into competitor analysis felt like mapping out the landscape and learning what others had built, and what gaps still needed to be filled. Building out personas and mapping user journeys brought the project to life for me, as I could better empathize with our users and see Luna through their eyes. Usability testing sessions then brought valuable feedback, showing where things clicked and where changes were needed to make the app welcoming and intuitive.</p>
                <p>Each step, from sketches to high-fidelity prototypes, added a new layer to Luna’s story, teaching me not just about design processes but about the people for whom we design. Ultimately, Luna became more than just a functional tool — it transformed into an experience that was engaging, friendly, and genuinely useful. This journey reminded me that thoughtful design, continuous iteration, and empathy are at the heart of creating products that truly make a difference.</p>
